      "negative_r2": "The model R² of -2.112464 is VALID for fixture data. Negative R² occurs when predictions are worse than predicting the mean. This happens because: (1) Fixture data has only 203 weeks vs ~5 years of production data, (2) Economic feature relationships may not hold in the truncated sample, (3) The benchmark (lagged sales) outperforms the economic model on this limited data.",
      "benchmark_vs_model": "The benchmark uses sales_target_contract_t5 (lagged sales) which performs well (R²=0.527) because recent sales predict future sales. The model uses economic features (prudential_rate, competitor rates) which require more data to establish relationships."
